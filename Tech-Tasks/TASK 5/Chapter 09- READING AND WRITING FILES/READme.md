# READING AND WRITING FILES


**In this chapter, I learned about what is meant by READING AND WRITING FILES in python.**
    
    1. Relative paths are relative to the current working directory.
    
    2. Absolute paths start with the root folder, such as / or C:\ .
    
    3. It evaluates to C:/Users/Al.
       
    4. On windows, it will show a TypeError as the first or second leftmost value must be a Path object for the entire expression to evaluate to a
       Path object.
    
    5. The os.getcwd() function returns the current working directory. The os.chdir() function changes the current working directory.
    
    6. The . folder is the current folder, and .. is the parent folder.
    
    7. C:\bacon\eggs is the dir name, while spam.txt is the base name.
    
    8. The string 'r' for read mode, 'w' for write mode, and 'a' for append mode.
    
    9. An existing file opened in write mode is erased and completely overwritten.
    
    10. The read() method returns the file’s entire contents as a single string value. The readlines() method returns a list of strings, where each
        string is a line from the file’s contents.
        
    11. A shelf value resembles a dictionary value; it has keys and values, along with keys() and values() methods that work similarly to the
        dictionary methods of the same names.
