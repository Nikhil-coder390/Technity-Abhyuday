# Entering Expressions into the Interactive Shell

**In this chapter, I learned about what is meant by expressions, operators, different types of data types, variable names,different types of functions, string concatenation and replication in python.**



# Practice Questions

1) *,-,/,+ are the operators
   -88.8,5 are the values
   'hello' is the string
   
2) spam is a variable
   'spam' is a string
   
3) int,float,char,string,double

4) Expression is a combination of values and operators.
   Example: 2 + 2 is a expression(combination of value 2 and operator "+"  where as a single value
   with no operator is also an expression.
   
   Expressions always evaluate down to a single value.
   
5) Expression is a combination of values, operators and always evaluate down to a single 
   value 
   Example: 3 + 4 * 5 = 23 is a expression
   
   Where as Statement is not a combination of values and operators but we can store values 
   using statements.

6) bacon = 21

7) Both the expressions gives same output
   'spamspamspam'
   
8) When compared to 100 egg is a valid variable name because 100 is a int and egg is a string 
   variable name should not start with a number
   
9) int(),float(),str()


10) 'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.' this expression results an error as we tried string concatenation by using integer
this can be sloved by using '99' 0r str(99) inplace of 99
EX: 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
    'I have eaten ' + str(99) + ' burritos.'
Output: I have eaten 99 burritos.
