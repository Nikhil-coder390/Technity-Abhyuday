# Functions

**In this chapter, I learned about what is meant by def statements with parameters, Argument, Parameter,Local and Global Scope in python.**
    
    1. A major purpose of functions is to group code that gets executed multiple times. Without a function defined, you would have to copy and paste
       this code each time.
    
    2. The code in a function is executed only if the function is called.
    
    3. The statement "def functionname(arguments)" is used to create a function by the name "functionname" containing the arguments upon which the
       function is applied.
       
    4. A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. 
       A function call is an expression that invokes the function and passes the arguments to it.
    
    5. There is only one global scope, and it is created when your program begins.
       There can be multiple local scopes in a Python program. A local scope is created whenever a function is called. Any variables assigned in the
       function exist within the functionâ€™s local scope.
    
    6. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and these variables are forgotten. The next time you call the function, the local
       variables will not remember the values stored in them from the last time the function was called.
    
    7. The value that a function call evaluates to is called the return value of the function.
       When an expression is used with a return statement, the return value is what this expression evaluates to.
   
    8. The function will return "None" without giving an explicit return value.
    
    9. If there's no such variable defined in the local scope, then the function will turn to global scope to look for that variable.
    
    10. The None value is the only value of the NoneType data type.
    
    11. imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.
    
    12. from spam import * bacon()
    
    13. Errors can be handled with try and except statements. The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause. The program
        execution moves to the start of a following except clause if an error happens.
        
    14. The code that could potentially have an error is put in a try clause.
        When code in a try clause causes an error, the program execution immediately moves to the code in the except clause.
